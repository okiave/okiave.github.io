# 100 Days Of Code - Log


:zap:**Disclaimer**:zap:: I will be using spanish here and there throughout  my log and im sure in the printed side of my projects. Helps keep my mental state of flow. Chido. Empezemos. 

Day 1 of 100days started on 1st day of 2018. All hours are in AKST (Alaska!!) I use moon emojis :new_moon_with_face::first_quarter_moon_with_face::full_moon_with_face::last_quarter_moon_with_face: to track my energy on this journey because I'm am a firm believer that the gravitational pull exerted on earth by the moon can be used as a leverage for productivity/restoration.

A few years ago my sister and I [lived nomadically ](http://avephoto.com/stories/#/south-of-here-1/) on a bikes. She is a scientist so we logged our progress and found our endurance and distance traveled seemed to correlate with the phases of the moon. Since then I've tested some of what we learned and started exploring a framework of mindfulness practices and cognitive behavioral tweaks to adapt to stress and challenges.

### Day 9: Enero 9, Tuesday

**__Progress__**: After completing the last three challenges of JQuery I'm starting my [first project](https://github.com/okiave/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/tribute-page.html) which is to build a tribute page using codepen on Alistair Cockburn.

**__Reflections__**: The prompt for the project used the term "*user stories*" that linked to wiki entry that referenced a man by the name of Alistair Cockburn who created Agile model for developing software. This immediately was my sign from the universe to make the tribute page about him because now I get to research the methodology and its origins. I'm also interested to better understand user stories. My decision to pivot toward dev skills is that I've found the life of a photographer too isolating when it comes to most projects. I really enjoy working on teams and see code as the context to get deeper into that world.

**__Learned__**: 

1. CSS Borders please

    This isn't new to me, however it was the first time I used it to understand makeup of a page with regards to visible elements and none visible elements. That in turn makes me see how laying out the initial [blocks stack up](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4628/38703743245_46f5d7fb1d_b.jpg) with CSS in place.
    

2. Data in Javascript

	One of the CS concepts I'm still wrapping my head around is how data is stored and passed on down the line. IDK how i found this but this [screencast video](https://scrimba.com/p/pRB9Hw/cN9EWSw) of a dad explaining to his son gave me a greater vocabulary. Now I know that arrays can be objects and be called in and that the values of labels can also be used.
When the dad was teaching his son about POJOs (Plain 'ol javascript object) also reminded me of pollo :chicken: and pollito :baby_chick:.
**__Tweaks__**:

* Gonna give these logs their due diligence so i can practice regurgitating more of what i learned.

### Day 8: Enero 8, Monday

**__Progress__**: Challenges 94-107 on Freecodecamp today were all about using CSS selectors to modify and remove html elements. JQuery can select elements in similar ways as CSS, it also has the ability control elements through parental or child positions.

**__Reflections__**: Early morning are absolutely the zone for me to learn. My mind is crisp and by reading out loud I grasp what's happening. I've noticed I can have a tendency to miss small details like capital letters mid selection or function which greatly affect the result. Also moving to standing desk for seshes keeps me way more attentive to how my body feels and that in turn proves to keep me more alert for learning.

**__Learned__**: 

1. $("document").ready(function()) {} );

    The $ at the start of the statement can be read as bling. Additional statements are put between the curly brackets {} and end with a semi-colon. Its also possible to combine multiple selectors together.

### :last_quarter_moon:Day 7: Enero 7, Sunday:last_quarter_moon:

**__Progress__**: Completed challenges 81-93 on Freecodecamp, got super into Bootstrap and am now officially entered JQuery waters.

**__Reflections__**: A lot of what astonishes me about the web is how much seems to get abstracted. To think that I will first be learning JQuery before js makes me consider whether this will hinder my future ability. I tend to lean on the side of knowing the origin of things in order to make sense of the present. Clearly I'm free to educate myself deeper than the challenges from FCC. Also got a new local buddy joining me on the FCC 


**__Learned__**: 

1. Bootstrap

    Is a CSS a framework that takes the math out of designing a responsive grid bc of it's built in classes. It uses a 12-column wide design that can be divided by thirds, quarters, halves. It's also got a ton of basic classes for making various elements pretty and gives you the ability to use font awesome easily. Now I'm curious to play with it on Kirbycms.
    

**__Tweaks__**:

* Moving to standing desk for code. I can feel my posture caving.  


---


### Day 6: Enero 6, Saturday

**__Progress__**: Completed challenges 25-80 on Freecodecamp on HTML and Bootstrap. 

**__Reflections__**: Some how I managed to skip to the Mongodb tutorial before I had even got into the JQuery challenges. I think this happened that day I did my 90min of code between errands in the car on an ipad while my sick Rio napped. In other news bootstrap is amazing! Back when I was self-learning css there was no such thing as responsive design and a lot of the pretty fancy things had to be done with background image placements and detailed grid positions. So glad that framework came to be.

**__Tweaks__**:

* Must clean up computer. Performance is too laggy.

### Day 5: Enero 5, Friday

**__Progress__**: Tweaked my github pages repo. 

**__Reflections__**: A week of with little exercise and major project management make for barriers to learning. The experiment to learn under stress is only manageable if I have a method for expressing the pent up energy. Looks like swimming, running, and roller skating are back in. My body needs that anaerobic hit of goodness at least three times a week.


**__Learned__**: 

1. Meltown/Spectre

    My recent learnings on arrays and their use of memory blocks brought enough insight that I could follow a rough understanding about how the current architecture/operations of modern CPUs can be used to access memory stored on CPU. 
    

**__Tweaks__**:

* More exercise, less coping behaviors  

* Continue with learnyoumongodb on cloud9.

---


### Day 4: Enero 4, Thursday

**__Progress__**: Created my github pages repo for publishing better updates. Learned about DOM, JSON structure and jQuery.

**__Reflections__**: Woke up feeling sick. It seems I picked up the stomach bug kiddos had. I plowed through my business todos and was ready to start learning by 830AM. My brain  is definitely better equipped to learn in the AM. Also found my coding glasses.


**__Learned__**: 

1. DOM

    The document object model is the element structure of an HTML document that breaks down the parent and children relationships to the elements within the html page. The neat thing about the console in the browser and DOM is you can interact with specific elements on the page using javascript. In this manner, it behaves like an api by receiving requests from console commands and returns results.
    
    
2. jQuery & Javascript
 
   My git repo got out of sync and I found this youtube vid that explained the mechanics of what goes on when repos are out of sync.
 * [Yourtube playlist to JS and jquery ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmayTjecwZXNigR19fK6xt51y8VBn-6Cw)
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Continue to learn about computer science aspects of arrays, conditionals, and events.

* Continue with learnyoumongodb on cloud9.

* learn how jekyll works to publish log there.

### Day 3: Enero 3, Wednesday

**__Progress__**: Mongodb running in AWS cloud9 and Git repo back in sync 

**__Reflections__**: Last night's late tweet on needing help bc he FCC tutorial no longer reflected changes made by AWS buyout was key. A long time twitter amigo [@knapkjack](https://twitter.com/knapjack/status/948572871156154368) found a git repo with directions to get rolling.  The video i watched last night while xcode downloaded gave me enough of a frame work that the the first two challenges of installing and verifying mongodb. Now that I've completed the first two exercises of leanrmymongo I can tell the new wall has to do with understanding the js syntax.


**__Learned__**: 

1. AWS/c9

    How to create a user for the IDE environment on c9 through AWS and install mongodb. Starting and stopping it as a service made sense bc I already new MYSQL and Apache also operated as services on a server. Also got to make a file in vim from scratch and how to name and save it.

* [Getting started with cloud9 on Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/nax3t/aws-cloud9-instructions/blob/master/README.md)    
* [Tutorial on Vim commands](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial)    
    
2. Git
 
   My git repo got out of sync and I found this youtube vid that explained the mechanics of what goes on when repos are out of sync.
 * [Merging remote changes explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6pxsaXAhbI)
       
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Define programing terminology: array and conditional statements

* Source a tutorial for understanding JS syntax

* clean up house to find my welding glasses for late night screen sessions.

### Day 2: Enero 2, Tuesday

**__Progress__**: Plowed through the freecodecamp.org (FCC) html/css challenges. Could not figure out how to install mongodb on AWS cloud9 so I jumped into local machine and am setting it up through brew.

**__Reflections__**: Ok so today, my son Rio was sick. Yesterday it was my daughter. NTL when he napped in the car I took the time to  review css/html challenges of FCC. This was fun bc the dopamine high i was on of knowing how to navigate those basics. Now that I'm at the node.js challenge the first hurdle will be getting a local version of learnmymongodb up and running. I may also just opt to do a docker image with all the goodies.

**__Learned__**: 

1. CSS - Multiple classes per element 

    This surprised me bc I thought I new CSS pretty well. Idk if this change was adopted from when I started learning CSS a decade ago. All you need is a blank space between multiple class names. Very cool.
    
2. AWS/cloud9/Brew
 
   I'm quasi familiar with AWS. Mostly the bucket aspect of AWS for years as additional remote storage for media. Today though I got to deploy my first instance and it was simple enough except for that I'm not familiar with how to navigate Amazon's flavor of Linux. It seems they use yum as package manager. I switched over to Brew locally and it turns out macOS High Sierra did away with the necessary dependencies in order to run mongodb so I'm now patiently waiting for all of xcode to install.
       
3. Mongodb - 

   Having troubleshooted some aspects of Wordpress, I was already familiar with the how a relational database organizes its contents. Watching a tutorial on mongodb blew my mind bc it connected the dots for how an app could scale dynamically based on demand. It was cool to see I could make sense of the JSON formatting thanks to my adventures in #maptime geoJSON data.
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Continue trouble shooting Xcode and MongoDb tomorrow in order to complete learnmymongodb challenge.

* Define programing terminology: array and conditional statements

* Finish Xcode and MongoDb install tomorrow.

* bring git repo back into sync with local.

* clean up house to find my welding glasses for these late night screen sessions.

###:full_moon_with_face: Day 1: Enero 1, Monday:full_moon_with_face:

**__Progress__**: Forked and pulled 100daysofcode project via terminal.
Updated and set intention for log via vim all the while utilizing what I've learned in my last weeks of typing practice..

**__Reflections__**: As freelancer and a father with a sick kiddo today; I see this 90min daily dedication succeeding best by allotting a time slot on the calendar.Especially considering that my first 30 days is trial to ingrain the routine and establish the systematic structure in my lifestyle to commit to a part-time code boot camp. I'm looking to pivot my career and fully formalize my knowledge of development by the end of 2018.This is exciting and equally challenging. That's a good sign because resistance in a journey brings real progress.

**__Learned__**: 

1. Vim 

    Is neat and I'm happy I got to learn a few more things about it like the SHIFT zz to save and close after exiting insert mode with ESC. Really though linear structure for to navigate typing is not gonna fly for future logging. Time for Coda.

2. Git/Terminal
 
   rm deletes file and rmdir deletes directory. If needing to remove directory with contents must use recursive flag -r. Re-learned that one must "git add" the file one intends to push before push.   
   
     
3. Markdown - Must look pretty

   After pushing my first commit i found the format of log needing love with some indentation and lists.  
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Tomorrow's 90min block to read the intro for javascript has been set to start at2100 after the hopefully not too ill kiddos have gone to bed. 

* I've also just turned off notifications for insta and will leave phone across room to charge while in session with this.

* Gonna implement 30 sec of belly breathing when i feel my brain tipping toward ADHD. Prolly have to do some jumping jacks here and there too.

### Day 0: Last half of Dec 2017
**__Reflections__**: Working on typing skills. Really should have taken that 7th grade class seriously. Thats ok im a fast learner and I've got the top row and middle row better mapped out. I even feel like Nikon from hackers every once in an while. ha! Def gonna keep up with awareness to the when find pecking and looking down come up.
